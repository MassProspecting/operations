="Create personalized outreach to the lead "&b2&" "&c2&" who published this post on LinkedIn:

"&b2&" "&c2&"'s ID is "&a2&".

```
"&j2&"
``` 

Such an outreach must share a proposal for improving even more what the lead is talking about in his/her post.

Such a proposal is about using RPA (Robotic Processes Automation).

It is very important that the lead feels that I spent the time reading his/her post and I seriously brainstormed a proposal for him/her.

Your work is to replace the merge-tags in the outreach template I will share below:

- mergetag 1: {no more than 15-word non-paraphrased description about the post that lead a stranger to understand what the post is about}
- mergetag 2: {no more than 35-word non-paraphrased description of a very specific way to improve something mentioned into the post using RPA technology}
- mergetag 3: {no more than 35-word example about how to implement the proposal above using RPA technology}

The value of merge tags must make the whole content of the outreach very congruent.

The values of merge tags can't be a word-for-word transcription of the original post, but a more casual comment of the post.

IMPORTANT: Don't add the following words into the body: medical, gift, new, free, cost, save, sales.

IMPORTANT: Don't add the following words into the subject: medical, gift, new, free, cost, save, sales.

This is the tamplate of the outreach I want to deliver:

**Subject**

```

Body:
