This is a javascript library called guid.min.js

**guid.min.js.js:**
```javascript
---
```

This is an HTML demo page:

**demo.html:**
```html
...
```

Can you please write a markdown document with the following titles:

- First, explain in 5-line about what is the guid.min.js.js library.
1. ...
2. ...
...
...

Can you write the HTML code to place just below the `h2` tag and to show the "...." feature.

I will need the javascript code too.
